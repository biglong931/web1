<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
